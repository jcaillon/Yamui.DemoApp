Yet Another Modern U.I. Framework - for WinForms 

This is an home made framework for my projects in C#, i fell in love with the mui look/feel (https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui) and decided to reproduce it for winforms applications. I still have a few controls to finish but it should be available soon...
